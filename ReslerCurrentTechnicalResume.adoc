== This Resume Has a _Dual-Read_ Design

*To save _you_ time, this resume reads 2 ways...*

1. Scan the *_Titles and Bold Font, to screen_ for a fit*
2. Read *_deeper where you have questions_*

_Having hired dozens of engineers myself, I hope this helps._

== Skip me, if...

- You just need something *"quick-and-dirty" and you don't care about the _total cost of
ownership_*.  My specialty is creating (or re-creating) clean, well documented _code that 
makes the whole team look good_.

+

In other words, *my code _protects you_, by making it easy for the _next_ person to modify it.*  It
takes a bit longer, but it saves countless hours, dollars, and bugs down the line.  If you _only_
need to "get stuff out the door", others are faster.

- Your project is *not _mainly_ Python (or possibly JavaScript)*.  While I enjoy other languages, I'd
rather be your _strongest_ Python developer, then your _weakest_ PHP hack.

== Consider interviewing me, if...

[[python_expert]] You want a Python Expert:: _No one knows everything, but you'll get your money's worth_.

+

Invested 15 man-years inventing, designing, writing, testing, and
maintaining a *51,000 line (SLOC), highly re-factored Python RAD business development framework
using an _agile, full test harness_ methodology.*

+

_Framework is like a Super-RAD Django or web2py that can write 3 month applications in 2 weeks._

+

Advanced Python *skills include replacing or improving core modules*, such as string,
inspect, datetime, exception and unittest.  Plus, used the hottest coding techniques from the latest
versions of Python.

You need Mission-Critical Reliability:: Average programmers are a dime a dozen. Few have 51,000 line
frameworks to their credit.  You _can't_ achieve this, without _great design, great documentation,
and exceptionally reliable code_.

You need to Communicate:: Software needs to _communicate_ with users, using clear inviting screens and clean
uncluttered output.

+

*Created all aspects of an Internet marketing site that delivered _marketing results, 30X industry
average_.*  +
_See Leadership Examples_

You want Unstoppable Results::  When you invent something, the "buck" stops with you.  _So, you
learn to solve any problem, no matter how tough._

You need Vision::  Using 2 digit years, my _earliest_ programs were Y2K compliant; decades before the
computer industry realized there would _be_ a year 2000.

You value Simplicity:: I have a _knack_ for *finding simple solutions to complex problems.*

You _don't_ want to be "Owned by the Programmer":: We've all seen the _"Empire Builder"_ who
writes _"spaghetti code"_ so complex, only _he_ can maintain it.  While _he gets short-term job
security, you get long-term headaches._  *My code actually _teaches_ the next person how to use it!*

== General Abilities

Use this section to *judge if I have the _aptitude_ you need.*  For example, could I write a low-level
interface?  Could I learn your business needs?  Could I lead a team?

=== Low-Level Skills

Programmed the _very_ first IBM PC in Missouri::  (Not the first model; the very first PC sold in
Missouri) Since there were no _PCs_, there were no classes to take, people to ask, or sites to
Google.  You *had to solve every problem*!

+

At the time, IBM Pascal was the best compiler, but the libraries were so primitive, you couldn't even
clear the screen.

- Created an interrupt driven, high-speed, *Pascal BIOS wrapper.*  This required analyzing the PC
BIOS source, and linking to a self-modifying, assembly language TSR (Terminate but Stay Resident)
interface.

- Created high-speed, *Pascal screen driver* that auto-detected video card buffers and wrote between
refresh cycles to be "flicker-free."  

- Created high-speed *window manager with "scrolling windows"* long before MS Windows.  Clients were
amazed by its *shocking speed.*

- Traded ideas with industry pioneers, such as Peter Norton (Norton Anti Virus) and John Sosha.

Created the First Reliable Windows SendKey Program:: As late as 2001, there existed no reliable
keyboard macro program for Windows.  Over time, even the best commercial programs dropped keys
frequently enough to crash mission-critical programs.
 
+

With a $2,000,000 program on the line, a desperate Scheduling Software VAR contacted me to create
a bullet-proof interface to the no-API data source he depended on.  *If he couldn't stop the crashes,
he was going out of business.*

+

In a few days, *wrote a C DLL that _never_ failed.*

+

How?  Having grown up with the PC, I remembered Bill Gates originally wanted Windows to open up in
a "Tutorial Mode".  As Bill's pet project, this hook _had_ to reliable, so I confirmed it was still
there, accepted the job, and wrote the code.  It's amazing the commercial vendors missed this.

=== High-Level Skills

Tool Development:: Life-time passion for pushing the software productivity envelope.  Created the
following tools.

- Pascal - development *framework* for early IBM PC
- dBaseII - *templating system*
- DataFlex 4GL - *application generator* wrapper
- MagicPC 4GL - *application generator* wrapper
- Python - *Custom RAD framework*

Rapid Application Development::  Using the above tools, specialized in writing highly reliable,
custom software for a fraction of the price. +
The following *examples are _not_ exaggerated:*

- A St. Louis based shoe company desperately needed a custom multi-size, multi-color inventory
control system. Personally *wrote inventory control, in 1 month*. The next bidder was $140,000, with
a _one-year_ delivery.

- When I took over as IT Director for a pharmaceutical company, the *company risked shutdown and
$millions in DEA fines*, because of buggy software.  Personally *rewrote 3 years of drug-tracking
software in 2 weeks, to eliminate the risk.*


Large Application Development:: 

- For a multi-state company, *wrote fast food chain software, after 2 Fortune 500 companies
failed.*  Software was end-to-end, from the store cash-registers, to the corporate consolidation and
management software.

- Wrote *three commercial grade accounting systems*, to include _General Ledger, Accounts
Receivable, Accounts Payable, Inventory Control, Bill of Materials, Order Entry, Sales Management
and Payroll._  Software *represents 150 person-years* (SLOC).

=== Leadership and Communication Examples

Lead 7 People to Write 50 Years Worth of Software in 2 Weeks::  Why would anybody attempt to
write 50 people-years worth of software in only 2 weeks?

_not_ make sense unless you understand _there was an urgent and compelling business need to prove the
worthiness of my software department._

+ 

As a young VP of Software Development, who had merged his company's assets with a larger company to
produce the first commercial 4GL accounting system, I wound up _betting_ the President my team could
write the whole package "in only 2 weeks, if the other managers would leave my programmers alone."

+

While admittedly heated for a few minutes, the conversation quickly became in a friendly, uplifting
challenge that rallied the whole company.  *The bet?  Custom T-Shirts and donuts!*

+

I knew we could do it, *if I could convince my team.*  So, after getting my project manager on
board, I pulled them into the conference room and locked the door.  "Team, we're about to do
something that _seems_ impossible. We're going to write the whole 50 year accounting system in the
next two weeks!  Why?  Because I heard one-time-too-many, that you guys were the reason the software
wasn't getting done, when I know you're the best there is.  So, if it takes the rest of the day,
that door only opens one of two ways."

1. I've convinced you, you _are_ the best, and we can do this with our technology.

2. I've convinced you I'm _nuts_, in which case you can spend the next 2 weeks at home, but you
_can't_ take credit when the rest of us pull this off.

+

*We won the bet!*  And, we earned the respect my team deserved.

New Internet Marketing Method:: Conceived of, and implemented a *new way to use Internet marketing
to _communicate the value of hard-to-explain products_* for business to business, or business to
consumer sales.

+

Studied top marketing experts to uncover _success patterns_.  Then broke with tradition to create a
fresh new way of contacting people with the utmost in respect and consideration.  The new approach
*delivered a 32 percent appointment ratio, when a 1 percent ratio is considered good.*

+ 

Designed and implemented all aspects of the project

- Web scrappers
- Telemarketing scripts 
- 20 minute video script, that kept them watching!
- Did "news anchor" style presentation for videos
- Web copy
- Web design
- Web software
- Custom Email system
- Tele-prompting software and scripts
- Marketing and educational films scripts and graphics
- Video voice over for marketing and educational films
- Video editing
- Custom charge-card system
- Etc.

+ 

*Stats:* From a phone-directory, cold-called 4,700 business owners to net 32 appointments per 100
contacts.  _The system produced so much new business, it could not be handled, and the telemarketer
had to be limited to 2 hours per day._


Other Leadership Examples::  *President, VP, Director and Project Lead.*  See chronology.

== Professional Chronology

[cols="2,6a"]
|=================================================================================================

|*Sep 11â€“Present*
|*Python Development â€“ Desktop to Web Conversion*  

Conversion of my 51,000 line (SLOC) cross-platform RAD development framework from a GUI/SQL
_desktop_ design, to an HTML5/NoSQL _Web_ design.

|*Feb 11-Aug 11*
|*Lead Web Developer â€“ Sypris Electronics Cyber Lab*

web2py Web portal: Developed the *secure Web portal* to company's flagship _Cyber-Range_ security training/testing lab.

Using the _web2py_ full-stack MVC framework Web framework, I did the "heavy lifting" to be handed off
to junior programmers.  Designed the site architecture, documentation, and enhancement methodology.
Replaced the web2py CRUD framework, with a more maintainable table-based CRUD design. Assisted other
developers to achieve a smooth transition.

|*May 07-Feb 11*
|*Web Development â€“ My Company*

*Innovative Internet Marketing Website:* Designed and created all aspects of an innovative, secured,
charge-card enabled, Internet marketing site--considered to be a breakthrough by veterans in the
industry. Also created all written, audio/video content used by thousands.

*JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX framework:* Developed JavaScript/jQuery cross-browser framework to handle
all functions needed by Website, such as current country scraping, form validation, cookie handling,
and so on.

*JavaScript/Python CGI Client Email Generator*: Wrote JavaScript/Python client Email generator to
send template based Emails for registered users. Automatically formats Emails and eliminates any
need for novices to understand web address or how to create Emails.

*JavaScript/Python CGI Website Tracker*: Created Tracker class to track all aspects of Website use
and store data in SQL database. Even tracked how far videos were played.

*JavaScript/Python CGI Secured Payment Processing API*: Reduced overly complex Authorize.net payment
processing API to 4 simple commands--Create,Update,Status and Cancel.

*JavaScript/Python MySQL CGI Class Wrapper:* Wrote powerful, light Python MySQL CGI wrapper to
handle SQL CGI back end. Wrapper generates SQL on-the-fly, from passed dictionaries, or static
templates for optimization. Wrapped in automatic test unit.

*JavaScript/Python CGI Cross-Domain WebScrapper*: Turned remote Website (with their permission) into
my own on-demand CGI database server.  Scrapped very complex broken HTML into meaningful data that
looked like it was coming from my server. Had to handle cookies and password logins.

*Python to HTML Website Generator:* Generated the complete Website from Python code using a single
command. Handled, audio, video, images, links, text, etc.  Automatically updated only the site
differences to prevent slowing live site with updates.

|*August 05-April 07*
|*QA - Emdeon (WebMD)*

In charge of Quality Assurance for ABF devision of Emdeon (originally WebMD). Hired from
contract-to-hire position to help maintain software and write automated test units for QA.

System was extremely complex with thousands of tables and programs written in many different
languages spread out over many servers. In addition to modifying the system, it was my
responsibility to develop test units to trap bugs and data errors. It required a team of 23
engineers to maintain this software, which printed millions of Insurance EOB pages and checks per
day.

Main technologies used: VB, Delphi, FoxPro, {cpp}, Python, Perl, Ruby and COM.

|*April 93-July 05*
|*Networking and Framework Development* (My Company)

In 2 weeks, used RAD development technology to personally rewrite and replace all failing mission
critical software that had been developed by an outside custom software firm over the prior 3 years.

Wrote DEA drug tracking software used internally by Bock.  The DEA agents preferred our system to
their own and used it to catch-up on their backlog.

In my first 2 weeks on the job, stopped "Big Four" accounting firm from implementing $400,000 MRPII
software system that would have been a disaster for our packaging division.  Successfully replaced
it with a more appropriate $60,000 system.

Designed and build custom high-capacity network file servers using PC technology saving more than
$300,000 _per year_ verses larger computer alternatives.

Hired, trained, developed and managed hardware, custom software and PC support staff supporting
